**🌧️ Enhancing Rainfall Forecasts with Ensemble ML**

Accurate rainfall prediction is crucial for agriculture, disaster management, and water resource planning.
This project leverages ensemble machine learning techniques to improve the accuracy and reliability of rainfall forecasts by combining the strengths of multiple predictive models.

**📚 Project Overview**

Traditional statistical methods for rainfall prediction often fail to capture the complex, non-linear patterns of weather data.
By integrating ensemble learning methods (e.g., Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Stacking), this project delivers:

More robust predictions by reducing overfitting and variance.

Improved generalization across diverse weather conditions.

Actionable insights to aid farmers, policymakers, and disaster response teams.

**🎯 Features**

🌦️ Multi-Model Rainfall Prediction using ensemble ML techniques.

📊 Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering for weather datasets.

📈 Performance Comparison between individual and ensemble models.

🌍 Visualization Dashboard for rainfall patterns and forecasts.

🚨 Early Warning System to support agriculture and disaster management.
